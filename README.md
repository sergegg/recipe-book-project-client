## Strategy to Solve Problems
My strategy to solve problems were refrerring to old projects I worked on in class. I also used sources I found through google, such as *Stack overflow*, *Code Academy*, *udemy* and others. Another strategy I used to solve problems is reviewing the steps I used to create the processes to make the program work. While reviewing the steps I used, I found minor errors such as spelling errors, typos, and errors of that nature which made the application work.
