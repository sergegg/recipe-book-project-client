# Recipe Book Project

## Planning Story
While considering my approach for project 2, I thought of what would be a fun project to create which may also be useful immediedtly. I came up with creating a recipe book which allows users to add and edit current owned recipes. I also want users to be able to comment on existing recipes and make it a really interactive app. I figured based on what we've learned so far that it is very doable.

## Development Process
I began with working on the project back-end first. I set up all of my recipe routes as well as my curl-scripts, models. While creating the model, I wanted it to contain another model within it, but I decided to keep it simple for v1. After finishing and confirming everything was functioning on the back-end, I worked on the front-end application by adding everything I needed into the HTML file, and following a similiar process I followed for project 1. index.html --> app.js --> events.js --> api.js --> ui.js --> styling the page.

## Strategy to Solve Problems
My strategy to solve problems were refrerring to old projects I worked on in class. I also worked with classmates to figure out issues I encountered. I also used sources I found through google, such as *Stack overflow*, *Code Academy*, *udemy* and others. Another strategy I used to solve problems is reviewing the steps I used to create the processes to make the program work. While reviewing the steps I used, I found minor errors such as spelling errors, typos, and errors of that nature which made the application work.

## Unsolved Problems
I am yet to create functionality to add pictures to recipes. I also am lacking functionality to sort by the 4 possible categories. And I do not have the preperation instructions to make a meal. Also when displaying all recipes the system displays one recipe twice.
